# Controlability
This notebook represents a test of operator controlability, whereby the dynamical Lie Algebra is calculated using the Python programming language and the simply module.
The necessity for operator controllability of the qubit array in universal quantum computing is typically fulfilled through the utilization of qubit-qubit couplings and local external controls on each qubit.
