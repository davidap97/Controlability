# Controlability
This notebook represents a test of operator controlability, whereby the dynamical Lie Algebra is calculated using the programming language Python and the SymPy module.
A full rank of the dynamical Lie algebra means that the quantum system under consideration is operator controllable. The necessity for operator controllability of the qubit array in universal quantum computing is typically fulfilled through the utilization of qubit-qubit couplings and local external controls on each qubit.
